Hi All,

My name is Sanjeev; I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Data Science and Engineering program at the Bredesen Center. 
My interest lies in Machine Learning, Bayesian Statistics, and Non-Linear Optimization. Earlier, I worked in the industry 
and worked on recommender systems, AB testing, and LTV analysis problems. I plan to pick an exciting problem from my area 
of interest or past work experience in this class and learn from other students' experiences and projects. I hope to 
have a great time in this class.

Thanks,
Sanjeev
