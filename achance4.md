My name is Andew Chance (I go by Andy), and I am in my final semester as a dual MBA-MS in Computer Engineering student.  I am not currently doing research, but I am interested in areas that allow me to combine both of my masters degrees, such as data science/data analytics or systems optimization methods (i.e., using programming to find an optimal solution to business case given certain paramters and constraints).
