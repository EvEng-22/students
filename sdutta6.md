Hi I am Senjuti Dutta, a 2 nd year PhD student in the Computer Science Department. I am focusing on HCI, crowdsourcing and ML. My current projects focus on crowdsourcing platforms and using ML approach to find out different type of crowdworkers using different approach. I would like to do a project related to crowdsourcing and ML. I am thinking about what problem I can solve for this project.
