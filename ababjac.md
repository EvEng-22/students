Hi, my name is Ashley Babjac and I am a second year PhD student working in Dr. Emrich's lab. My research projects mainly involve applications of machine and deep learning to large biological datasets. My two most recent projects involve unsupervised clustering on different datasets including mRNA abundance and beetle pathology, and autoencoder applications to sparse ocean MAG data with SVM prediction.
